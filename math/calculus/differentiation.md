# Limits and Continuity

$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
$$

* $f$ approaches $L$ as the input $x$ approaches $a$. 
* More formally, we define limits as:

$$
\forall \epsilon \exists \delta (0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies |f(x) - L| < \epsilon)
$$

* A function is continuous at a point $x=a$ if the limit at that point is equal to $f(a)$.

$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)
$$

* We can define continuity of $f$ in an interval $I$ if $f$ is continuous for points contained in $I$.  

# Single Variable Derivatives
* Average rate of change

$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$
