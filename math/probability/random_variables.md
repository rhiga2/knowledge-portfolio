Discrete Random Variables
================
# Random Variables
* A random variable is a function that assigns a real number to elements in the sample space. For example, a coin flip can be represented by function mapping tails to $0$ and heads to $1$.
* Note that any function applied to a RV is a RV. 

# Discrete RVs and Probability Mass Functions (PMFs)
* For discrete RV, we can assign probability to each value of the RV.
* Probability mass function defines the distribution of discrete RVs. 

$$
p_X(x) = P(X=x)
$$

* Note that $\sum_x p_X(x) = 1$.

# Expectation and Variance
* Expectation measures the center of the distribution.

$$
EX = \sum_x xp_X(x)
$$

* Law of the Unconscious Statistician (LOTUS)

$$
Ef(X) = \sum_x f(x)p_X(x)
$$

* Variance measures the spread of the distribution. A higher variance means the distribution is more spread out. 

$$
E[(X - EX)^2] =
